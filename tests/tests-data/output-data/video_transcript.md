00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.380
As I look back on the mission that we've had here on the International Space Station,

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.380
I'm proud to have been a part of much of the science activities

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.860
that happened over the last two months.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.860
I didn't think I would do another spacewalk,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.860
and to now have the chance to have done four more

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.860
was just icing on the cake for a wonderful mission.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:38.140
It's hard to put into words just what it was like to be a part of this expedition, Expedition 63.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.140
It'll be kind of a memory that will last a lifetime for me.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.140
It's been a true honor.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.140
The hardest part was getting us launched,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.140
but the most important part is bringing us home.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.820
Thank you, Planet Earth, and thanks for flying SpaceX.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.820
It was truly our honor and privilege.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.820
Space Dads are back on Earth after a 19-hour return journey from space.
